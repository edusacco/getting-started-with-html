<h1><b>INTRODUCTION TO PROGRAMMING - Stage 0</b></h1>
<!-- This is my first attemp to write HTML code -->
<h2> Basic Concepts </h2>
<i><b>The World Wide Web (or the Web):</b></i>
The World Wide Web (www) is an information system of interlinked hypertext documents-it's sort of a collection of <em>HTML documents</em>-that are accessed via the Internet. It has also commonly become known simply as the Web. Each file on the web can be located through its uniform resource locator (or URL). For more on the world wide web see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">[Wikipedia]</a>.

<p>  

<i> <b> The Internet:</b> </i>The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that use the standard Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link several billion devices worldwide. <p> 

<i> <b> Web Pages:</b> </i>
Individual document pages on the World Wide Web are called web pages-there are over 30 billion pages. Web pages may contain text, images, videos, and other multimedia components, as well as web navigation features consisting of <em>hyperlinks</em>.
</p>
<i> <b> Web Browser:</b> </i>
Web pages are accessed with a software application running on the user's computer, commonly called a <em>web browser</em>. 

<p>
<i><b>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML):</b></i> HyperText Markup Language, commonly referred to as HTML, is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of tags enclosed in angle brackets. HTML is made up of text content, markups-made up of things called tags, references to other documents, images, videos and links to other pages. HTML documents contain text content which describes "what you see" and markup which describes "how it looks" when, for instance, you visit a web page.

</p>
<i> <b> Html Tags and Elements:</b> </i> HTML documents are made of HTML <u>elements</u>. An HTML <u>element</u> refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags. <p> When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML tags. An explanation of how this works can be found by <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/?mkt_tok=3RkMMJWWfF9wsRokvKzBZKXonjHpfsX66u0sXKawlMI%2F0ER3fOvrPUfGjI4DSsVkI%2BSLDwEYGJlv6SgFTLHGMbdlwLgJWBg%3D#!/c-nd000/l-3851658626/m-3847388548">clicking here</a>. Examples of tags are: "b" for bold, "i" for italics, "em" for emphasis-italics, "p" for paragraph, "a" for anchor, "br" for break or void tag, "img" for images. <p>Tags can have one or more <u>attributes</u>. An <u>attribute</u> is a property of an HTML element. 
</p>
<i><b>Inline vs Block Elements:</i></b> HTML elements are either inline or block. While <em>Inline</em> elements look linear, <em>Block</em> elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.

<h2> Thinking Like a Programmer </h2>
To think like a programmer you must develop <i>procedural thinking</i>, <i>abstract thinking</i>, <i>systematic debugging</i> (the skill through which programmers identify problems and/or potential problems and then track down potential causes for those problems until they are found and fixed), <i>technological empathy</i> (understanding how a computer see things), and <i>systems thinking</i> (taking one big idea and break it down into its component pieces).
